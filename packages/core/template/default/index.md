## What just happened?

You have just initialized a _default_ MarkBind site! It is equipped with a set of core features, including site and page navigation. Additionally, we have included some convenient links to our User Guide, to help you get started quickly and easily.

<box type="tip">

If you were intending to convert an existing GitHub wiki or a docs folder into MarkBind, use the `--convert` flag instead. See <a href="https://markbind.org/userGuide/markBindInTheProjectWorkflow.html#converting-existing-project-documentation-wiki" target="_blank">User Guide: MarkBind in the Project Workflow</a> for more information.

If you want to start with a <tooltip content="i.e. without any content">_minimal_</tooltip> template instead, use the `--template` flag with the "minimal" option to initialize a minimal site instead of the default. See <a href="https://markbind.org/userGuide/templates.html" target="_blank">User Guide: Templates</a> for more information.

## Navigating this site

This _default_ site comes pre-configured with the core <a href="https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/navigation.html#navigation-components" target="_blank">Navigation components</a>: a <tooltip content="Site Navigation">**siteNav**</tooltip>, a <tooltip content="Page Navigation">**pageNav**</tooltip>, a <tooltip content="Navigation Bar">**NavBar**</tooltip>, and a **Search Bar**. To help you get started with the **siteNav**, we have included <tooltip content="Topic 1, Topic 2, Topic 3, Topic 3a, Topic 3b">five dummy placeholder pages</tooltip>. The **NavBar** also comes with a placeholder slot for your custom Logo.
