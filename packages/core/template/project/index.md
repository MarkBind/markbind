**ProjectEx is an example project application used for showcasing a default MarkBind template specifically for project documentation.** 

<box type="info">

Take this template as a _starting point_ for your project documentation, taking reference of what would be in a typical project documentation site, replacing the content with your own.
</box>

* If you are interested in using ProjectEx, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](userGuide/QuickStart.html).
* If you are interested about contributing to developing ProjectEx, the [**Developer Guide**](developerGuide/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
