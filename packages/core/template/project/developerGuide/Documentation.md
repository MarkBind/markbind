# Documentation Guide

<box type="tip">
This page can be used to understand the documentation practices and link to relevant sources to help developers contribute to documentation.
</box>

* We use [**MarkBind**](https://markbind.org/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder contains the source files for the documentation website.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Working with Forked MarkBind sites](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind-forked-sites.html) for project documentation.

Updating documentation as changes are made to the project is ideal for any project.
