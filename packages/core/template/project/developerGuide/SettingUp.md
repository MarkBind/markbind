1. **Verify the setup (optional)**:
   1. Run the `build` and `serve` commands, ensuring that the site properly deploys on your local host.

## Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**

   **Tip:**
   You can easily customize your IDE's coding style through settings.

1. **Set up CI**

   This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.

1. **Learn the design**

   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about [ProjectExâ€™s architecture](Design.md#Architecture).

1. **Do the tutorial**

   The [Tracing Code tutorial](TracingCode.md) can help you get acquainted with the codebase.
