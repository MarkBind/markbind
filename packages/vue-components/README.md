# MarkBind Vue components

This folder contains MarkBind's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) UI components.

Most of the styles are based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS, but no dependency on Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:

* [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) (required ^v2.x.x, test with v2.5.16).
* [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/) (required 4.x.x, test with 4.1.1). MarkBind's Vue components doesn't depend on a very precise version of Bootstrap.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (tested with v3.5.1) full build.

## Components / directives

Many of the components under this folder were originally from [MarkBind/vue-strap](https://github.com/MarkBind/vue-strap), forked from [yuche/vue-strap](https://github.com/yuche/vue-strap), and modified to suit MarkBind's needs for educational and documentation websites.
