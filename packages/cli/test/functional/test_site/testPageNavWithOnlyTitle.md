<frontmatter>
  layout: default.md
  pageNav: 1
  pageNavTitle: Title in Page Nav
</frontmatter>

Since a page nav title has been added to `frontmatter`, it should show in page nav component/section of the page.

Hence, the separator i.e., `border-left: ...` should now be present in the above mentioned component.
