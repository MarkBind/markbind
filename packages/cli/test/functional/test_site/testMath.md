Solve the following simultaneous equations:

\[ 3x + y = 11 \] (1)

\[\frac{2x}{3} + \frac{2y}{3} = 8\] (2)

Euler's equation \( e^{i\pi}+1=0 \) is a beautiful equation.

Stirling's approximation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
n! = \sqrt{2 \pi n} (\frac{n}{e})^n e^{\alpha_n} \\
where \\
\frac{1}{12n+1} < \alpha_n < \frac{1}{12n}
\end{aligned}
