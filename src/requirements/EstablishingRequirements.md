# Establishing Requirements
<seg id=preview>Requirements gathering, requirements elicitation, requirements analysis,
requirements capture are some of the terms commonly **and** interchangeably used to represent the activity
of understanding what a software product should do.</seg>

There are many techniques used during a requirements gathering. The following are some of the techniques.

## Brainstorming  
Brainstorming is a group activity designed to generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas for the solution 
of a problem. In a brainstorming session there are no "bad" ideas. 
The aim is to generate ideas; not to validate them. Brainstorming encourages you to "think outside the box" and 
put "crazy" ideas on the table without fear of rejection.

## User surveys
Carefully designed questionnaires can be used to solicit responses and opinions from a large number of users regarding 
any current system or a new innovation.

## Focus groups  
Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting. A group of people 
(e.g. potential users, beta testers) are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process.  
Focus groups can bring out undiscovered conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be 
resolved or clarified as necessary.
