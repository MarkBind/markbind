**Normal footnotes:**
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote. Footnotes will appear at the bottom of the page.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.


**Inline footnotes:**
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
