# Path within the boilerplate folder is separately specified

This is dynamically included.  

Like static include, pages within the site should be able to use files located in folders within boilerplate.  

Also, the boilerplate file name (e.g. `inside.md`) and the file that it is supposed to act as (`notInside.md`) can be different.

This file should behaves as if it is in the `requirements` folder:  

<panel header="Tested with the folllowing include" src="NonFunctionalRequirements.md" >
