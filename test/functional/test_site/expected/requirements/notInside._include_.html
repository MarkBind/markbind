<p>This is dynamically included.</p>
<p>Like static include, pages within the site should be able to use files located in folders within boilerplate.</p>
<p>Also, the boilerplate file name (e.g. <code>inside.md</code>) and the file that it is supposed to act as (<code>notInside.md</code>) can be different.</p>
<p>This file should behaves as if it is in the <code>requirements</code> folder:</p>
