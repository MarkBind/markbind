<h1 id="specifying-requirements">Specifying requirements</h1>
<p>
  <seg id="preview">As we establish requirements, they should be recorded in some way for future reference, usually called a requirement specification. Furthermore, it is advisable to show these requirements to stakeholders, and refine requirements based on their feedback.
    The next phase is to convert requirements into a product specification that specifies how the product will address the requirements. </seg>
</p>
<p>Given next are some tools and techniques that can be used to specify requirements. Note that they can also be used for establishing requirements too.</p>
<h2 id="textual-descriptions-unstructured-prose">Textual descriptions (unstructured prose)</h2>
<p>This is the most straight forward way of describing requirements. A textual description can be used to give a quick overview of the domain/system that is understandable to both the users and the development team. Textual descriptions are especially useful
  when describing the vision of a product. However, lengthy textual descriptions are hard to follow.</p>
<h2 id="feature-list">Feature list</h2>
<p>It is a list of features (or functionalities) grouped according to some criteria such as priority (e.g. must-have, nice-to-have, etc. ), order of delivery, object or process related (e.g. order-related, invoice-related, etc.). Here is a sample feature
  list from Minesweeper (only a brief description has been provided to save space).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Basic play – Single player play.</li>
  <li>Difficulty levels – Additional Medium and Advanced levels.</li>
  <li>Versus play – Two players can play against each other.</li>
  <li>Timer – Additional fixed time restriction on the player.</li>
</ol>
