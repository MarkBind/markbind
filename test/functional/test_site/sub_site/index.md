## Feature list
It is a list of features (or functionalities) grouped according to some criteria such as priority 
(e.g. must-have, nice-to-have, etc. ), order of delivery, object or process related

Here is a sample feature list from Minesweeper (only a brief description has been provided to save space). 

1. Basic play – Single player play. 
2. Difficulty levels – Additional Medium and Advanced levels.
