of understanding what a software product should do.</seg>

There are many techniques used during a requirements gathering. The following are some of the techniques.

#### Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a group activity designed to generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas for the solution
of a problem. In a brainstorming session there are no "bad" ideas.
The aim is to generate ideas; not to validate them. Brainstorming encourages you to "think outside the box" and
put "crazy" ideas on the table without fear of rejection.

#### User surveys
Carefully designed questionnaires can be used to solicit responses and opinions from a large number of users regarding
any current system or a new innovation.

#### Focus groups
Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting.
A <tooltip content="e.g. potential users, beta testers">group of people</tooltip>
are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process.
Focus groups can bring out undiscovered conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be
resolved or clarified as necessary.
