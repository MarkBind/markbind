User stories are brief (typically, 1-3 sentences) descriptions of what the system can do for the users, 
written in the customersâ€™ language. Often, user stories are written by the customers themselves.

A commonly used format for writing user stories is:<br> 
**`As a`** `<use type/role>` **`I can`** `<function>` **`so that`** `<benefit>`

Here are some examples of user stories for the IVLE system:
```bat
* As a student, I can download files uploaded by lecturers, so that I can get my own copy of the files.
* As a lecturer, I can create discussion forums, so that students can discuss things online.
* As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets, so that I can take attendance during the class.
```

The `<benefit>` can be omitted if it is obvious. E.g. As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets.
User stories are mainly used for early estimation and scheduling purposes. 

According to <ref xp-website>this<ref/>, the biggest difference between user stories and traditional requirements 
specifications is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk 
estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story, 
the developers will meet with the customer face-to-face  to work out a more detailed description of the requirements.

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate 
planning and discussion.
