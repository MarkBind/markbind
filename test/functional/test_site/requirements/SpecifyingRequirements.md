# Specifying requirements 

<seg id=preview>As we establish requirements, they should be recorded in some way for future reference,
usually called a requirement specification. Furthermore, it is advisable to show these requirements to stakeholders, 
and refine requirements based on their feedback. The next phase is to convert requirements into a product 
specification that specifies how the product will address the requirements. </seg>

Given next are some tools and techniques that can be used to specify requirements. 
Note that they can also be used for establishing requirements too.

## Textual descriptions (unstructured prose)
This is the most straight forward way of describing requirements. 
A textual description can be used to give a quick overview of the domain/system that is understandable to both 
the users and the development team. Textual descriptions are especially useful when describing the vision of a product. 
However, lengthy textual descriptions are hard to follow. 

## Feature list
It is a list of features (or functionalities) grouped according to some criteria such as priority 
(e.g. must-have, nice-to-have, etc. ), order of delivery, object or process related 
(e.g. order-related, invoice-related, etc.). 
Here is a sample feature list from Minesweeper (only a brief description has been provided to save space). 

1. Basic play – Single player play. 
2. Difficulty levels – Additional Medium and Advanced levels.
3. Versus play – Two players can play against each other.
4. Timer – Additional fixed time restriction on the player.
