<p>User stories are brief (typically, 1-3 sentences) descriptions of what the system can do for the users, written in the customers’ language. Often, user stories are written by the customers themselves.</p>
<p>A commonly used format for writing user stories is:<br>
  <strong><code>As a</code></strong> <code>&lt;use type/role&gt;</code> <strong><code>I can</code></strong> <code>&lt;function&gt;</code> <strong><code>so that</code></strong> <code>&lt;benefit&gt;</code></p>
<p>Here are some examples of user stories for the IVLE system:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bat">* As a student, I can download files uploaded by lecturers, so that I can get my own <span class="hljs-built_in">copy</span> of the files.
* As a lecturer, I can create discussion forums, so that students can discuss things online.
* As a tutor, I can <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> attendance sheets, so that I can take attendance during the class.
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;benefit&gt;</code> can be omitted if it is obvious. E.g. As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets. User stories are mainly used for early estimation and scheduling purposes.</p>
<p>According to
  <ref xp-website="">this
    <ref></ref>, the biggest difference between user stories and traditional requirements specifications is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement.
    When the time comes to implement the story, the developers will meet with the customer face-to-face to work out a more detailed description of the requirements.</ref>

<p>User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion.</p>
