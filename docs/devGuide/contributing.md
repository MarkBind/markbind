### How to make Pull Requests to submit changes?

Please follow the steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks) are passing
3. You can then [request for a review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review)
   - Not sure who to ask a review from? A good rule of thumb is to check recently [merged](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) or [approved](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+review%3Aapproved) pull requests, and see who the reviewers are. It's likely that they are currently active and willing to review your pull request as well!

Reviewer(s) may request additional changes from you in terms of implementation, design, tests, style, or other changes before your pull request is finally approved.
