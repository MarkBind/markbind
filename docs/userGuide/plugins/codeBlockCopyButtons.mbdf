#### `codeBlockCopyButtons`: Enabling code-blocks to be copied

This plugin allows you to copy code in code-blocks on a button-click.

To enable it, simply add `codeBlockCopyButtons` to your site's plugins.

```js
site.json
{
  ...
  "plugins": [
    "codeBlockCopyButtons"
  ],
}
```

This is what it'll look like once added - 

<pic src="{{baseUrl}}/images/copyCode.png" width="750" alt="copyCode"/>
