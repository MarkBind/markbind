### Plugin: `codeBlockCopyButtons`

This plugin adds a 'copy' button to fenced code blocks so that readers can copy the code easily.

To enable it, simply add `codeBlockCopyButtons` to your site's plugins.

```js {heading="site.json"}
{
  ...
  "plugins": [
    "codeBlockCopyButtons"
  ],
}
```

This is what it'll look like once added

<pic src="{{baseUrl}}/images/copyCode.png" width="750" alt="copyCode"/>
