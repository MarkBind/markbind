### Plugin: Disqus 

This plugin allows you to use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for your site.

<box type="info">

Before you can use this plugin, you need to **(1) setup a Disqus account** and **(2) register your site**. 

You may sign up for a Disqus account and register your site [here](https://disqus.com/admin/create/). 

Note that you **++do not have to install Disqus on your site++**, this plugin does it for you. 

All you have to do is provide the `shortname` of your Disqus site, which is explained below.

To enable this plugin, add `disqus` to your site's plugins, and supply the required options via the `pluginsContext`.  

Name | Type | Default | Description
---- | ---- | ------- | ------
shortname| `String` || Shortname is provided by Disqus. Follow this [guide](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname) to get shortname for your Disqus site.

```js {heading="site.json"}
{
  ...
  "plugins": [
    "disqus"
  ],
  "pluginsContext": {
    "disqus": {
      "shortname": "YOUR_DISQUS_SITE_SHORTNAME", // replace with your Disqus site's shortname 
    }
  }
}
```

Then, to add a Disqus comment section on a page, all you need to do is to add a `<disqus/>` HTML tag to any MarkBind source file. 

<box type="tip">

It may be a good idea to create a [layout]({{ baseUrl }}/userGuide/tweakingThePageStructure.html#layouts) with `<disqus/>` in it, so that you won't have to repeat it on every page.
