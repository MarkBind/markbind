##### :fas-lightbulb: Escaping Characters

For Markdown syntax: To display a literal character that are normally used for Markdown formatting, add a backslash (`\`) in front of the character.

{% raw %}

##### :fas-lightbulb: Using {% raw %}{% endraw %} to display `{{ content }}`

By default, MarkBind processes any code in the form of `{{ content }}`. This is because Nunjucks (which is [supported by MarkBind](markBindSyntaxOverview.html#support-for-nunjucks)) uses this syntax to [evaluate an expression, variable, or function calls](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#variables). For instance:

```
{{ username }}
```

This will not display `{{ username }}` as a raw string, but instead, look up the variable `username` from the context and display its value.

In general, to use this syntax as a raw string in a code block or a template, there are [two methods](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#escaping) available. The syntax can either be encased as a variable like `{{ '{{' }}` and `{{ '}}' }}`, or alternatively, the entire code block can be encased with the raw-endraw tags: `{% raw %} {{ content }} {% endraw %}`. 

<box type="info">

If using raw-endraw tags outside `<code>` elements, markdown code fences, or inline code, you also need to add the `v-pre` attribute. 

For HTML elements, the `v-pre` attribute needs to be declared as part of the HTML tag:

```
{% raw %}

<div v-pre>
  <p>{{ content }}</p>
</div>

{% endraw %}
```

For Markdown elements, the `v-pre` attribute needs to be declared using [`markdown-it-attrs`](formattingcontents.html#classes-attributes-and-amp-identifiers), which allows classes, identifiers, and attributed to be added to Markdown syntax:

```
{% raw %}

# Header with {{ content }} {v-pre}

{% endraw %}
```

Otherwise, any HTML or Markdown content containing double curly braces will be processed as a variable and will not be displayed properly.

Note: This step isn't necessary for `<code>` elements, markdown code fences and inline code because MarkBind automatically adds `v-pre` for them.

##### :fas-info: Unwanted starting space in links and triggers

When you use links or triggers, you may encounter a situation where an unwanted space is being generated by MarkBind:


* Code:<br>
  ```
  The
  [[link](https://example.com)].
  ```

* Expected output:
  <code>The [[link](https://example.com)].</code>

* Actual output (notice the additional space in front of the link):
  <code>The [ [link](https://example.com)].</code>

* Solution:
  Wrap the link or trigger around with `<md>` tags.
  ```
  The
  <md>[[link](https://example.com)]</md>.
  ```

##### :fas-info: Configuring Online Deployment platforms to use specific MarkBind version

**Configuring CI platforms to use specific MarkBind version**

When the [default CI configuration for deployment](deployingTheSite.html#using-ci-platforms) is used, the latest version of MarkBind will be used in the CI workflows. This may be a later version of MarkBind than the one you use locally.

* If you want to specify a version of MarkBind (eg. `v1.6.3`), you have to modify the step where `markbind-cli` is being installed to `npm i -g markbind-cli@v1.6.3`. For example, for Travis-CI, you can modify the `install` step in `.travis.yml` as follows:

  ```yaml
  install:
    - npm i -g markbind-cli@1.6.3
  ```
* If you want to use the latest minor version automatically until the next major version (as major versions usually contain breaking changes), you can add a `^` in front of the version number. In the example below, Travis will use the latest version of MarkBind but will stop before `2.*`

  ```yaml
  install:
    - npm i -g markbind-cli@^1.6.3
  ```

**Setting up Netlify to use a specific version of MarkBind**

Here are the steps to set up Netlify to use a specific version of MarkBind.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your site.
1. Run `npm init` which will create `package.json` and `package.lock.json`
1. Run `npm install markbind-cli@1.6.3 --save` to install MarkBind as a dependency (using v1.6.3 as an example)
1. Create / Update `.gitignore` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   node_modules
   ```
1. Update `ignore` in site.json to include
   ```
   node_modules/*
   .gitignore
   ```

1. Now, follow the [previous instructions for setting up Netlify](deployingTheSite.html#deploying-to-netlify) but with the following difference:<br>
   In step 5, Set the ==Build Command== to `markbind build --baseUrl`

<div id="indentComponents">

##### :fas-lightbulb: Indent components

In some cases, you may want to indent components such as panels and boxes to match the surrounding content.
This is easily achieved by adding some margin and padding utility classes from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/spacing/) 
to the component. The following examples show how to do this.

**Indent Box component**

<include src="codeAndOutput.md" boilerplate >
<variable name="highlightStyle">html</variable>
<variable name="code">

<box>Some text at level 1</box>

<box class="ms-4">Some text at level 2</box>

<box>Some text at level 1</box>

</variable>
</include>

**Indent Panel component**

<include src="codeAndOutput.md" boilerplate >
<variable name="highlightStyle">html</variable>
<variable name="code">

<panel header="This panel is at level 1">
  ...
</panel>
<panel header="This panel is at level 2" class="ms-3">
  The "ms-3" is arbitarily chosen i.e "ms-0" to "ms-5" are all possible values.
</panel>
<panel header="This panel is at level 1">
  ...
</panel>
</variable>
</include>

**Indent Included component**

The following box component will be included via `<include>`.

<div id="forIndentDemo">
<box>Some text from include</box>
</div>

<include src="codeAndOutput.md" boilerplate >
<variable name="highlightStyle">html</variable>
<variable name="code">

<box>Some text at level 1 (before included content)</box>
<include src="tipsAndTricks.md#forIndentDemo" class="ms-5"></include>
<box>Some text at level 1 (after included content)</box>

</variable>
</include>

</div>
