Site versioning is key for documentation use, and websites may want to keep past versions for archival purposes. MarkBind can help you easily archive your site.
</div>

## Archiving with a CLI command

Markbind allows you to easily save a version of the site you've built to be hosted at the same site with a modified URL with a single CLI command. All intralinks within the archived site will point to the respective archived pages. By default, the archive folder is called `version`, but you may specify your own directory.

For example, if your site's base url relative to your domain is 'my_site', and you archive a version named 'v1' in the default archive folder, then by navigating to the url `<domain>/my_site/version/v1/<someFile>` you would have accessed the archived version of someFile.

A `versions.json` file will be created to track the archived sites you have made, and to exclude the archived sites from being re-archived the next time you make a new version. Modify it with caution, as it may result in unnecessary files being included or necessary files being excluded.
