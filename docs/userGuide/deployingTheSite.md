**A site generated by MarkBind can be deployed by simply uploading the generated files to any Web server.** In addition, MarkBind provides several convenient deployment options.
</span>

Generic steps for deploying a MarkBind site:
1. Set the [`baseUrl` property of the `site.json` file](siteJsonFile.html#baseUrl) to match the deploy location.
1. (Optional) Use the [`markbind serve` command](cliCommands.html#serve-command) to stage the site locally and confirm the contents are as expected.
1. Use the [`markbind build` command](cliCommands.html#build-command) to generate the site from source files. That command puts the generated site files in a directory named `_site` (you can change the output directory using parameters supplied to the command).
1. Upload the site files to the Web server. The sections below explain how to automate this step if you are deploying to some online platforms.


Steps for deploying multiple MarkBind sites:
1. Create multiple `site.json` files. Ensure that the [`baseUrl` property of each `site.json` file](siteJsonFile.html#baseUrl) matches its deploy location.
1. (Optional) Use the [`markbind serve -s <file>` command](cliCommands.html#serve-command) to stage each site locally and confirm the contents are as expected.
1. For each site:
    1. Use the [`markbind build -s <file>` command](cliCommands.html#build-command) to generate the site from source files.
    1. Upload the site files to the Web server. The sections below explain how to automate this step if you are deploying to some online platforms.


## Deploying to Github Pages

**MarkBind can easily deploy a site to [Github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)** if the project root directory is also a GitHub repo.

Running the **`markbind deploy`** command will deploy the most recent build of your site to the `gh-pages` branch of the repo `origin` and will be available
After the command is completed, your site will be online at `http://<username|org>.github.io/<repo>` e.g., http://se-edu.github.io/se-book.

<div id="warning-about-baseUrl">

<box type="warning">

If you are deploying to the site to GitHub pages, the `baseUrl` setting in the `site.json` should be set to the `"/<repositoryName>"` for the links in the deployed site to work correctly.<br>
{{ icon_example }} If you are using Github Pages to host your deployed website at repo `myorg/myproduct` (i.e., the website is published at `https://myorg.github.io/myproduct`), then your `baseUrl` should be `"/myproduct"`.
</box>
</div>

You can override the default deployment settings %%(e.g., repo/branch to deploy)%% in the `site.json`'s `deploy` section:

<panel type="seamless" header="**User Guide: Configuring the Site → `deploy`**" popup-url="siteJsonFile.html#deploy">
  <include src="siteJsonFile.md#site-json-deploy" />
</panel>

<br>
<box type="warning">

`markbind deploy` does not generate the static site from your source; it simply deploys the files that are already in the `_site` directory. You need to run `markbind build` first if you want to generate the site before deploying.
</box>

### Deploying to GitHub Pages via CI Tools
**You can setup CI Tools to automatically build and deploy your site on GitHub Pages every time your GitHub repo is updated.**

<box type="important" light>

Markbind currently supports deploying to Github Pages via [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) or [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/).

##### Adding your repository to Travis CI

<panel header="{{icon_info}} Travis CI Migration" type="info" expanded>

Since May 2018, Travis CI has been [undergoing migration to `travis-ci.com`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-on-travis-ci-com/), which changes the way you setup repositories on Travis CI. 

- If you are new to Travis CI, you should **add your repository on `travis-ci.com`**.
- Alternatively, if you are already using Travis CI on `travis-ci.org`, you can continue to **add your repository on `travis-ci.org`**.
</panel>

</tabs>

##### Configuring your repository in Travis CI

1. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/#creating-a-token) with **repo** permissions. Take note of the generated token - you will not be able to see it again once you navigate away from the page.
<include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="GitHub Token Repo Permissions" var-file="githubTokenRepoPermissions.png" inline />
1. [Add an environment variable in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with the value set to the personal access token generated in the previous step. ==Ensure that _Display value in the build log_ is set to _Off_.==
   <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Add GITHUB_TOKEN" var-file="travisGithubToken.png" inline />
1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to instruct Travis CI to build and deploy the site when you push to the repository. An example `.travis.yml` file that can accomplish this is given below:
```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 10
install:
  - npm i -g markbind-cli
script: markbind build
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: markbind deploy --travis
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    branch: master
```
More information about `.travis.yml` can be found in the [Travis CI documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/).

1. Commit `.travis.yml` to your MarkBind repository and push the changes. Travis CI should begin to build your site.
1. Select the MarkBind repository on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/auth) and [check the build status](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/#breaking-the-build) to see if it is successful.
1. Once the build succeeds, your MarkBind site should be online at `http://<username|org>.github.io/<repo>` e.g., http://se-edu.github.io/se-book. Travis CI will automatically build and deploy changes to your site as you push new changes to the repository after a few seconds.<br>
  %%{{ icon_info }} You might have to go to the `Settings` of your repo and configure it to publish GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch as MarkBind deploys to that branch by default.%%

###### Configuring Travis CI to use a specific MarkBind version

When Travis CI is set up as explained above, it will use the latest version of MarkBind which may be a later version than the one you use locally.
* If you want Travis CI to use a specific version of MarkBind (eg. `v1.6.3`), change the `install` step in the `.travis.yml` given above to:
  ```yaml
  install:
    - npm i -g markbind-cli@1.63
  ```
* If you want to use the latest minor version automatically until the next major version (as major versions usually contain breaking changes), you can add a `^` in front of the version number. In the example below, Travis will use the latest version of MarkBind but will stop before `2.*`
  ```yaml
  install:
    - npm i -g markbind-cli@^1.63
  ```

###### Configuring Travis CI to only deploy from a specific repository

When Travis CI is set up as explained above, Travis CI will attempt to deploy the site from any repository it is in, including forks.
If you want Travis CI to only deploy from a specific repository (eg. only from your main site repository), you can add to the `deploy` phase a [`repo` condition in the form `owner_name/repo_name`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment#conditional-releases-with-on).

For example, if you only want Travis CI to deploy the site when it is run from the `se-edu/se-book` repository, the following `repo` condition should be added to `.travis.yml`.

```yaml
  on:
    branch: master
    repo: se-edu/se-book
```

The `repo` value can be changed to your specific repository as desired.

1. Navigate to the project settings page of your repository in AppVeyor CI.
1. On the left menu, click on __Environment__.
1. Under the heading __Environment variables__, add a custom environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with the value set to the personal access token that was generated in the first step. ==Ensure that you toggle variable encryption by clicking on the padlock.== 
  <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Add GitHub Token on AppVeyor" var-file="appveyorGithubToken.png" inline />
1. Remember to click __Save__ at the bottom of the page.
1. Add a `appveyor.yml`file at the root of your Markbind site's repository to instruct AppVeyor CI to build and deploy the site to Github Pages when you to push to your repository. More information on customizing `appveyor.yml` can be found in [AppVeyor documentation](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/). An example `appveyor.yml` file is given below:
```
environment:
  nodejs_version: '10'

branches:
  only:
    - master

install:
  - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version
  - npm i -g markbind-cli
  - markbind build
  - markbind deploy --ci

test: off

build: off
```

Commit and push `appveyor.yml` to your github repository. Thereafter, AppVeyor CI should begin to run the build script. You are able to view the current build status by clicking on your repository in the [AppVeyor projects page](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects). Once the build succeeds, you should be able to view your Markbind site, after a few seconds, at `http://<username|org>.github.io/<repo>` e.g., http://se-edu.github.io/se-book.

## Deploying to Netlify

**You can setup [<tooltip content="a platform for deploying static webpages (among other things)">Netlify</tooltip>](https://www.netlify.com/)
 to automatically build and deploy your site on their platform every time your GitHub repo is updated.**

Here are the steps to set up Netlify:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/ and sign up
1. Next go to https://app.netlify.com/account/sites and select `New site from Git`
1. Select your git provider
   <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Create a new site" var-file="netlifyPreview1.png" inline />
1. Select your markbind site repository
   <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Select repository" var-file="netlifyPreview2.png" inline />
1. Update the build settings as follows and hit `Deploy site`:
   - `Build Command`: `npm i markbind-cli -g && markbind build --baseUrl`
   - `Publish directory`: `_site`
   - `Show advanced`: Add a new variable with the key as `NODE_VERSION` and the value as **`10` or higher**
   <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Update build settings" var-file="netlifyPreview3.png" inline />
   <include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Advanced build settings" var-file="netlifyPreview3-advanced.png" inline />

Now your site will be deployed on Netlify at the given address specified after deployment. It will be updated automatically when the default branch of your repo is updated.

Additionally, **when contributors make a pull request to your GitHub repo, you can _preview_ the updated site** at the bottom of the pull request by clicking on `details` link in the PR:
<include src="screenshot.md" boilerplate var-alt="Preview deploy" var-file="netlifyPreview4.png" inline />

{{ icon_info }} Note that when Netlify is set up as explained above, it will use the latest version of MarkBind which may be a later version than the one you use locally. If you want Netlify to use a specific version of Netlify, follow the instructions in the box below:

<box>

##### Setting up Netlify to use a specific version of MarkBind

Here are the steps to set up Netlify to use a specific version of MarkBind.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your site.
1. run `npm init` which will create `package.json` and `package.lock.json`
1. run `npm install markbind-cli@1.6.3 --save` to install markbind as a dependency (using v1.6.3 as an example)
1. create/update `.gitignore` file in the root directory and add:
   ```{.no-line-numbers}
   node_modules
   ```
1. update `ignore` in site.json to include
   ```{.no-line-numbers}
   node_modules/*
   .gitignore
   ```

1. Now, follow the [previous instructions for setting up Netlify](#deploying-to-netlify) but with the following difference:<br>
   In step 5, ==Set the `Build Command` to `markbind build --baseUrl`==
