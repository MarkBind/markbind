# MarkBind User Guide

MarkBind enhances markdown and html documents with extra features that allow you to compose content-extensive website from document fragments at ease.

MarkBind provides many useful markups (customized HTML tags) to help you create complex and interactive components with simple tags such as `<panel>` and `<popover>`. The reference for all supported customized elements could be found at [VueStrap modified by MarkBind](https://markbind.github.io/vue-strap/).

Take a look at the [quick start guide](userQuickStart.html) to start building your website with MarkBind.
