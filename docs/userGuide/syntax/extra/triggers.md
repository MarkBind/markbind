****Triggers****

Trigger provides more flexibility in triggering contextual overlay via Tooltip, Popover or Modal.

You could embed a Trigger within the text, and define the Tooltip, Popover or Modal at a separate location, which allows for a cleaner authoring flow.

Specify the `id` attribute on the Tooltip, Popover or Modal component, and use the same `id` in the `for` attribute of the Trigger to allow the Trigger to invoke the specific overlay elements.
Additionally, multiple Triggers could share the same overlay by providing them with the same `id`.
<br />

**Trigger's `trigger` attribute (which defaults to `hover`) is independent of the target's.**

****Options****

Name | Type | Default | Description
---- | ---- | ------- | ------
trigger | `String` | `hover` | How the overlay view is triggered.<br>Supports: `click`, `focus`, `hover`.
for | `String` | `null` | The id for the overlay view to be shown.
placement | `String` | `auto` | How to position the Popover or Tooltip.<br>Supports: `auto`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`.
