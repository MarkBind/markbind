## Collapse/Expand All Buttons

 The collapse/expand all buttons component provides an easy way for readers to expand and collapse all dropdowns in the site navigation.

 #### Usage

 Include the collapse/expand all buttons component (`<collapse-expand-buttons />`) in the layout file to add the buttons to your page. The buttons can be added to any location within the site navigation and will always appear at the top right of it.

```html
<nav id="site-nav">
...
<collapse-expand-buttons />
...
</nav>
```
You can see an example of collapse/expand all buttons on the top right of the site navigation that is located on the left of this page.
