The advantage of font icons over emojis is font icons can be _styled_ to fit your needs. e.g.,
* emoji: <span style="color: purple">Don't judge the :book: by it's cover! :-1:</span>
* font icons: <span style="color: purple">Don't judge the :fas-book: by it's cover! {{ icon_dislike }}</span>
</span>
</include>

<box type="important">
The syntax for icons has changed, and the earlier {<span></span>{ prefix_name }} syntax has been deprecated. <br>
Please use the new :prefix-name: syntax instead.

###### Using Font Awesome Icons
1. Decide which icon you want to use from the [list of available icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free).
1. Construct the MarkBind name for the selected icon by adding the _type prefix_.
   Note: Font Awesome has three different styles for their icons, each with their own type prefix. Here is an example from each type:
   * _Solid_ (prefix: `fas-`) e.g., :fas-file-code: (actual name `file-code`, MarkBind name `fas-file-code`)
   * _Regular_ (prefix: `far-`) e.g., :far-file-code: (actual name `file-code`, MarkBind name `far-file-code`)
   * _Brands_ (prefix: `fab-`): e.g., :fab-github-alt: (actual name `github-alt`, MarkBind name `fab-github-alt`)

1. Insert MarkBind name for the icon enclosed within colons to get the icon in your page.<br>
  `Create a **branch**`<code>:<span></span>fas-code-branch: now!</code> → Create a **branch** :fas-code-branch: now!


###### Using Glyphicons

1. Decide which icon you want to use from [list of provided glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#glyphicons).
1. Insert the name for the icon enclosed within colons to get the icon in your page.<br>
  `Move to the right!`<code>:<span></span>glyphicon-hand-right:</code> → Move to the right! :glyphicon-hand-right:

<span id="short" class="d-none">

<code>:<span></span>glyphicon-hand-right:</code> <code>:<span></span>fab-github:</code> <code>:<span></span>fas-home:</code>

</span>

<span id="examples" class="d-none">

:glyphicon-hand-right: :fab-github: :fas-home: %%:glyphicon-hand-right: :fab-github: :fas-home:%% <span style="color: red">:glyphicon-hand-right: :fab-github: :fas-home:</span>
